                            <h2>The Epic Journey</h2>
                            <p>We cycled 870 kilometers for those few seconds. The famous Giro d'Italia started in Hungary this year, and we went to see it—on bikes, of course. We took a train to České Velenice, then cycled to Vienna, the next day to Hungarian Győr, and then hurried to Lake Balaton. One of the stages finished there.</p>
                            
                            <p>In the morning, we rode part of the race route, and in the afternoon, we watched the peloton zoom past us. The next day, we cycled along Lake Balaton to Keszthely, where we soaked in the thermal river at Hévíz spa nearby. In the afternoon, we arrived in Sárvár. On the last day, we casually rode to Bratislava, from where we took the train home.</p>
                            
                            <p>Our journey took us through four countries—Czech Republic, Austria, Slovakia, and Hungary—experiencing diverse landscapes from the flowing Danube cycle paths to the volcanic terrain north of Lake Balaton. The trip culminated in witnessing the exhilarating power of the Giro d'Italia peloton during the Hungarian stage.</p>

                            <p>Welcome to our multi-part series: DEMENTIS GO TO GIRO! Our goal is to reach Lake Balaton to catch a glimpse of the famous Giro d'Italia peloton, which started in Hungary this year. On the first day, we departed from České Velenice and cycled to Vienna—a 160-kilometer journey with 1,400 meters of elevation gain.</p>
                            
                            <p>The first 80 kilometers took us through gentle rolling terrain until we reached the Danube River at Krems an der Donau (aka Krems). From here, it was all cycle paths, and the profile became very friendly as the route slightly descended during the second half of our stage. The monotony of the Danube cycle path was broken up by passing through Tulln. From there, it was just 40 kilometers to Vienna, where we spent the night before heading to Gabčíkovo and Győr the next day.</p>

                            <p>Bratislava and 30 monotonous kilometers along the Gabčíkovo dam were the highlights of the route from Vienna to Győr. Győr is a beautiful, vibrant city, and we had enough energy to explore it because, although we cycled 160 km, we only climbed a mere 170 meters. So, cheers, and tomorrow we head to Lake Balaton!</p>

                            <p>We spiced up our journey to Balaton with a detour to an abandoned Csárda (traditional Hungarian inn) and even had time for a photo session in a clover field. Is Hungary flat? Essentially, yes. But north of Balaton is a region of several former volcanoes, so we managed to climb over 1,000 meters during our 150-kilometer ride. Then it was just a descent to Lake Balaton. We spent the night in the town of Balatonfüred, which is the finish line for tomorrow's Giro d'Italia stage. We are Dementis!</p>

We found a great roadside fish restaurant and then waited for the peloton. Within seconds, a herd of cyclists rushed past us. The peloton literally blew wind as it passed. Before the riders circled the Tihany peninsula, we moved to another spot to cheer once more. Incredible power and speed! Our expedition was also a success for friends watching back home on TV. We are Dementis!</p>

                            <p>The Giro is over, and it's time to slowly head home, but we'll make it nice. We headed to Sárvár, cycling along Lake Balaton for almost half the journey. We were surrounded by former volcanoes, like the one near Badacsonytomaj. On another hill sits Szigliget Castle. We made a significant stop in the beautiful town of Keszthely. From here, it was just a few kilometers to the Hévíz spa, where we swam in a thermal river. Now only 70 km remained to our destination. A flat tire was inevitable; otherwise, we'd be bored on such flat terrain. And here's Sárvár. We dined in the center, finally traveling light without our bags. WE ARE DEMENTIS.</p>

                            <p>It's the sixth and final day of our Hungarian cycling adventure. Honestly, the only thing on our minds was reaching Bratislava to catch the train. On the last day, we simply pedaled. By the finish, we had 870 kilometers in our legs. Compared to other cycling trips, Hungary is a very easy destination—virtually no elevation gain. Not a single day did we exceed 1,000 meters of climbing. We replenished our energy and arrived in Bratislava. The first Dementis epic journey to the Hungarian stage of the Giro d'Italia came to an end. Our train didn't leave for two hours, so there's nothing left to do but toast: Cheers! WE ARE DEMENTIS!</p>
